nuke-ms is intended as a multi-platform, reliable and secure instant messaging
system.

The goal of this project is to create a messaging system that is secure,
stable, efficient and powerful.

The communication architecture shall be scalable reaching from simple peer to
peer communcation and a client/server model to, broad distributed web of
communication nodes.

Security shall be achieved by applying modern cryptographic methods to
authentication of and encryption of messages of all including parties, wether
human oder automated.

The resulting code shall be mature, well tested, effective and
comprehensible; only high-quality and multi-platform libraries shall be used.
Defects of the code, documentation or environment must not be hidden or
obfuscated, instead these defects shall be addressed openly, fast and
responsibly.

Clear guidelines and extensive and comprehensible documentation shall be an aid
to both contributors and users and ensure clarity of the development process
and functionality of the software.

The project shall reach a broad audience and impose as few restrictions on the
usage as possible. This shall be achieved by opening the program to as many
platforms, languages, use cases and audience skills as possible.

The development process must be open and have many possibilities
for contribution.
nuke-ms is free software and dedicated to the FLOSS Community. Distribution and 
modification are allowed and well appreciated.
