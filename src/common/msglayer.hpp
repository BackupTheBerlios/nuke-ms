/** @file msglayer.hpp
* @brief Message Layer Interface
*
* This file contains declarations and definitions of the Message Layer
* infrastructure.
*
* When data is intended to be sent over the network, the data normally is
* encapsuled in many layers, several "headers" are attached to it.
*
* The idea behind this class hierarchy is to ease and unify the handling of
* encoding and decoding messages into messages of a lower or upper layer.
* To clarify the use of this class hierarchy, one hypothetical procedure of
* sending a message is explained.
*
* The message travels from the user "down the pipeline" to the network, where it
* can be sent.
* At the beginning the user enters some data (e.g. a text message). This data is
* encapsuled in a wrapper tagging the message with metadata (like username,
* font...). Let's call this layer "layer A".
* Then message of layer A is encrypted becomes a message of layer b.
* Finally the message is serialized. To ensure wholeness of the message, it is
* encapsuled in a segmentation layer, layer C.
*
* At this moment the message looks like this:
* layer C object holds a copy of the layer B object, which holds a copy of layer
* A object, which holds a copy of the text the user entered.
* Now, the message can be sent over the network.
*
*
* This is what happens on the receiving site:
* The header of the segmentation layer message (layer C) arrives at the
* receiving site. The receiving site allocates memory and receives the
* rest of the message.
* Then, the message is passed "up the pipeline" to a responsible function
* which determines the correct layer of the message (layer B in our case) and
* passes the message on to the next layer handling function. His layer B
* function unpacks the encapsuled layer A message which is then finally
* displayed back to the user.
*
*
* Implementation
*
* The message pipeline is implemented by a class for each layer. An object of
* this class is therefor considered as a message of this layer.
* Although the above explanation would suggest that each layer holds a copy of
* it's upper layer, it is up to the implementation of a layer to decide wether
* the data is held as a reference or a copy.
* Normally a layer only adds a small header (compared to the size of the
* original message) to the message and passes it down to the next layer. It
* would be waste of memory and computation time to copy the data of each upper
* layer into the current layer.
* To avoid this, layers should hold their data as a reference counted shared
* pointer. Only when necessary - usually when the data is actually sent over the
* network - the data is serialized and written into a single buffer. This buffer
* is sent over the network, and the original data chunks (headers + user data)
* are discarded (and deleted!).
*
*   Sending messages
*
* When sending messages, the size of the message has to be determined
* and the data has to be serialized.
* To determine the size, a request is made up the pipeline:
* layer C asks layer B, which in turn asks A which knows
* the size of the original message. The value travels back down the pipeline,
* where at each step the header size of each layer is added.
* To serialize the message, layer C serializes its header and asks B to
* serialize. B in turn serializes its header and asks A to serialize. A
* serializes its header and appends the text data. The network layer can then
* send the serialized data.
*
*  Receiving messages
*
* The main memory allocation for an incoming message should be performed at the
* very beginning, right before receiving the message body of the segmentation
* layer. The whole block should be kept in memory and the message layers pass
* ownership to this block and iterators upwards. This is a tradeoff:
* At the expense of unnessecary bytes being held in memory, additional memory
* allocations and copy operations can be prevented. This should be a good
* tradeoff because "normally" the headers on the messages are relatively small
* and memory waste is neglectable.
* If for a layer the cost becomes to high (if its header is rather big), it
* can decide to discard the old buffer and allocate a new smaller buffer.
*
