/** @file msglayer.hpp
* @brief Message Layers
*
* When data is intended to be sent over the network, the data normally is
* encapsuled in many layers, several "headers" are attached to it.
*
* The idea behind this class hierarchy is to ease and unify the handling of
* encoding and decoding messages into messages of a lower or upper layer.
*
* To clarify the use of this hierarchy, one hypothetical procedure of sending a
* message is explained:
* The user enters some data (e.g. a text message). This data is
* encapsuled in a wrapper tagging the message with metadata (like username,
* font...). Let's call this layer "layer A".
* Then message of layer A is encrypted becomes a message of layer b.
* Finally the message is serialized. To ensure wholeness of the message, it is
* encapsuled in a segmentation layer, layer C.
*
* The layer C object holds a copy of the layer B object, which holds a copy of
* layer A object, which holds a copy of the text the user entered.
*
* To be able to send this message, the size of the message has to be determined
* and the data has to be serialized.
* To determine the size, the request is made "up the pipeline":
* layer C asks layer B, which in turn asks A which knows
* the size of the original message. The value travels back "down the pipeline",
* where at each step the header size of each layer is added.
* To serialize the message, layer C serializes its header and asks B to
* serialize. B in turn serializes its header and asks A to serialize. A
* serializes its header and appends the text data.
*
* This message pipeline is implemented by a class for each layer. An object of
* this class is therefor considered as a message of this layer.
* Although the above explanation would suggest that each layer holds a copy of
* it's upper layer, it is up to the implementation of a layer to decide wether
* the data is held as a reference or a copy.
* Normally a layer only adds a small header (compared to the size of the
* original message). Therefor it would be waste of memory and computation time
* to copy the data of each upper layer into the current layer.
* To avoid this, layers should hold their data as a reference counted shared
* pointer. Only when necessary - usually when the data is actually sent over the
* network - the data is serialized and written into a single buffer. This buffer
* is sent over the network, and the original data chunks (headers + user data)
* are discarded (and deleted!).
*
* Let's examine the handling of the message on the receiving side:
* The header of the segmentation layer message (layer C) arrives at the
* receiving site. Then the receiving site allocates memory and receives the
* rest of the message.
* Then, the message is passed "up the pipeline". However, the code that handles
* new messages doesn't know what kind of message (which layer) it has received.
* Therefor, layer C is holding a reference to a message of an "unknown message
* layer". The layer C message is passed to the next handling code. This
* code inspects the "unknown message layer" message and tries to make sense of
* it. If it does, the appropriate message layer (let's say it's layer B) is
* constructed from the unknown message layer. The upper layer contained in this
* layer B message is still unknown, and will be a "unknown message layer"
* message. The message is passed up to the next handling code, the data is
* investigated and the appropriate layer (let's say layer A) is constructed.
* The string message contained in layer A is then displayed to the user.
*
* The main memory allocation for an incoming message should be performed at the
* very beginning, right before receiving the message body of the segmentation
* layer. The whole block should be kept in memory and the message layers pass
* ownership to this block and iterators upwards. This is a tradeoff:
* At the expense of unnessecary bytes being held in memory, additional memory
* allocations and copy operations can be prevented. This should be a good
* tradeoff because "normally" the headers on the messages are relatively small
* and memory waste is negelctable.
* If for a layer, the cost becomes to high (if its header is rather big), it
* can decide to discard the old buffer and allocate a new smaller buffer.
