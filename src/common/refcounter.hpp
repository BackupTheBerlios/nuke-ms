/** Count references to the current object.

* This can be usefull if the lifetime of an object is dependent on the
* references held to it.
* In short, to ensure that the object is alive as long as there are references
* to it.
* To do so, derive the Class you want to have reference counted from this class
* template. When you need a counted reference, create a CountedReference object
* with *this as constructor argument, and make copies of it at will.
* Construction of CountedReference objects will increase the reference count,
* destruction will decrease the reference count.
*
* When the reference count reaches zero by decreasing, the action specified in
* the constructor will be executed.
